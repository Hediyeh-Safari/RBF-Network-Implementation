# RBF-Network-Implementation
Creation of a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF NN) featuring Gaussian kernel functions with a consistent spread function. This design involves utilizing all data points within the training set as centers for the Radial Basis functions (RB functions).


This code generates a dataset with 441 samples. Each sample has two features represented by the coordinates (x, y) in the range of -2 to 2. The labels for the samples are assigned based on whether the sample falls within a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin.
